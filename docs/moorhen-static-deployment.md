# Moorhen Backend And Static Deployment Requirements

Moorhen is the application's only molecular viewer. Its threaded WebAssembly runtime requires the page to be
cross-origin isolated. Frontend JavaScript cannot enable this after the HTML document has loaded, so the backend or
edge proxy serving Fragalysis owns part of the runtime contract.

## Backend And Platform Owner Checklist

1. Add `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` to every Fragalysis HTML response.
2. Add `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` to every Fragalysis HTML response.
3. Apply both headers to redirects and error responses using nginx/ingress `always` behavior or outermost Django
   middleware.
4. Preserve the headers through every CDN, ingress, reverse proxy, and WAF layer.
5. Serve Moorhen `.wasm` files as `application/wasm`.
6. When Moorhen assets are on another origin, return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and
   `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` from that static origin.
7. Verify the deployed Preview page reports `window.crossOriginIsolated === true` before enabling user traffic.

The frontend contains blob bridges for development deployments where Django and the Webpack asset server use
different origins. Those bridges solve browser worker URL restrictions; they do not remove the top-level
COOP/COEP requirement.

## Generated Assets

`yarn copy:moorhen-assets` replaces `bundles/moorhen` with the complete contents of
`node_modules/moorhen/public` and verifies every relative path, byte count, and SHA-256 digest. The output is
generated and remains ignored through the existing `bundles/` rule.

The local asset base URL is `/bundles/moorhen`. Production must publish `bundles/moorhen` below the same static
root used for the Webpack bundle. A deployment that prefixes frontend static files should preserve the directory
and configure the future Moorhen wrapper with that prefixed base URL.

The normal `start`, `build`, `watch`, and `dev` scripts run the copy step. GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and the Docker
build additionally run `yarn verify:moorhen-assets` after the production build.

## Required Response Headers

The top-level Fragalysis HTML response must include both headers below. Adding them only to WASM or JavaScript
responses does not make the page cross-origin isolated.

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Frontend static responses should also include this header, especially when the development bundle is served from
port 3030 while Django runs on another origin:

```text
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
```

The local Express server sets all three headers and serves `.wasm` as `application/wasm`. The Django development
response and the production proxy must mirror the two isolation headers on the document response. The frontend
development compose file mounts `docker/nginx/moorhen-isolation.conf` into its backend container as a local-only
workaround. The current backend image already emits COOP, so this file deliberately adds only the missing COEP/CORP
headers to avoid an invalid duplicate COOP policy. Production infrastructure must configure its own equivalent
policy and ensure each policy header occurs exactly once.

For Django, use response middleware at the outer application boundary so error responses are covered too:

```python
class CrossOriginIsolationMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        response = self.get_response(request)
        response["Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy"] = "same-origin"
        response["Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy"] = "require-corp"
        return response
```

For nginx or an ingress controller, apply the equivalent headers with `always` semantics at the server or ingress
response level. Ensure the active MIME types table contains:

```nginx
application/wasm  wasm;
```

Map the generated directory from the frontend build image, for example from `/frontend/bundles/moorhen`, into the
deployed static URL. Do not serve `node_modules` directly.

Ingress installations differ in whether response-header snippets are permitted. Configure the two isolation
headers through the platform's supported response-header policy and verify them after deployment rather than
assuming an annotation was accepted.

## External Resources

`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` blocks cross-origin subresources unless they opt in through CORS or a
compatible Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy. The RDKit script request now uses anonymous CORS. Backend API/media hosts,
fonts, images, and other scripts must remain same-origin or return suitable CORS/CORP headers.
Top-level links and downloads opened as navigations are not embedded resources and do not need CORP.

## Deployment Check

After deploying, verify representative responses:

```bash
curl -I <fragalysis-origin>/viewer/react/preview/target/<target>/tas/<project>
curl -I <static-root>/bundles/moorhen/CootWorker.js
curl -I <static-root>/bundles/moorhen/moorhen.wasm
curl -I <static-root>/bundles/moorhen/baby-gru/monomers/a/ALA.cif
```

The document response must contain COOP and COEP. All three asset responses must return HTTP 200, the WASM response
must use `Content-Type: application/wasm`, and the browser console must show `window.crossOriginIsolated === true` on
the Fragalysis page before Moorhen initializes.
